  WHAT IS CORONA VIRUS ?
</h1>
<p>
  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
  syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.
  The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019
 (COVID-19).

  <h2><font color="black">What causes a coronavirus infection?</font></h1>
    <font  color="white">Humans first get a coronavirus from contact with animals. Then, it can spread from human to human. Health officials do not know what animal caused 
    COVID-19.<br>
    The COVID-19 virus can be spread through contact with certain bodily fluids, such as droplets in a cough. <br>It might also be caused by touching something 
    an infected person has touched and then touching your hand to your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>

<a href="#">Origin of Coronavirus</a>
<p>An outbreak of the coronavirus (now called COVID-19) in China is causing global concern. It came from a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, China, in December.
  It has since spread to other countries, including the United States.
  Despite Wuhan and other Chinese cities being quarantined, the COVID-19 has spread to almost 70 locations internationally. In the U.S., COVID-19 cases have 
 been confirmed and deaths have been reported.
</p>
<p>A coronavirus is a virus that is found in animals and, rarely, can be transmitted from animals to humans and then spread person to person. 
  In addition to COVID-19, other human coronaviruses have included: <br>The MERS virus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.<br>
  The SARS virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which first occurred in the Guangdong province in southern China.
